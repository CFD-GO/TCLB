
We are really glad, that you would like to contribute to TCLB, bu for everyone's sake we will appreciate that you will:

== Check ==

[] Original references - some paper/book, so original author will be noted and others will know what was exactly implemented

[] Wiki references     - some new futures/models/configure args etc? Did you made proper wiki entry and did you made proper link in code

[] Issues references     - bugfix? Maybe "fixes #xx" ?

[] Author references     - use a template "# Maintainer: Michal Dzikowski @mdzik" So we know who's model is it. You could use "Implemented by", if you don't want to take care of a model in the future.

== Coding standard ==

[] clever trick? leave a note ;)

[] don't brake naming convention (at least look at surrounding)

[] try too use meaningful variable names

== Cross compile ==

[] CPU x86_64

[] GPU CUDA 2.5 / double precision
