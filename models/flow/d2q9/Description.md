The `d2q9` model is a basic 2D Lattice Boltzmann Method model for flow
simulation.

It is a implementation of a simple Multiple-Relaxation-Time collision
operator.

The model has one [option](/basics/options/): BC. This option turns on
custom fields for setting non-standard profiles on inlets and other things.
